        <p>Feedbands began in 2010 with what founder Graham Langdon describes as “a musical awakening”. Dancing at a Rebelution concert in Hawaii, he experienced a peak moment. “I could literally feel the music in every cell of my body. I realized music is the destiny of humanity and the meaning of life. Or mine, at least. After that, I wanted to be immersed in music all the time.” The next morning, Graham was determined to live in a house filled with musicians. Wasting no time, he founded the first Feedbands house later that week on Big Island. He invited musicians to come stay and jam, but he quickly realized he’d have more exposure to constant music in California.</p>
        <p>We plant trees while you stream. Our mission is for music to reforest the planet. We plant 1 tree for every 100 streams on our website and apps. Our goal is to plant 1 billion trees by streaming 100 billion songs.</p>
